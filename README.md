## I little bit about me

- 🌱 Currently, I’m a Master's student in biostatistics at [the Unversity of North Carolina Chapel Hill](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/). I graduated with a B.A. in Statistics (with minors in biology and computer science) from [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) in 2023.
- 🧬 **Exploring the Genetic Frontier**: My academic interests lie in dissecting complex data and employing novel statistical approaches to shed light on rare genetic variants. My dedication to this field fuels my quest for breakthroughs that could potentially impact lives for people with rare diseases!
- 📊 **Bridging Science and Business**: My ambitions extend beyond the realms of science and math. I envision harnessing the biostatistical expertise I've gained through extensive data analysis and research to create impacts for real business needs. I'm a bold explorer, detail catcher, and an active thinker, who's ready to apply these skills to address real-world challenges.
- 🔬 **Part-Time Researcher, Full-Time Student, Lifelong Explorer**: Balancing my role as a part-time researcher with my commitment as a full-time student, I am constantly pushing my boundaries to learn, grow, and adapt. I see life as an endless exploration, where each day brings new opportunities to expand my horizons.
