### Hello ä½ å¥½ ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a MS candidate in biostatistics department at the Unveristy of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. I graduated with a B.A. in Statistics (with minors in biology and computer science) from Macalester College in May 2023.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more statistical courses to enrich my study life! Who would know this! I was a biology and no math person for half my college life and have once decided to do pre-med
programs. But I found out I really hated Physics so I gave up on that. But anyways, I am now excited to reunion with biology from statistical perspectives.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on statistical genetics projects that involves cancer and GWAS. Researching for research is in progress!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about K-pop, EDM, China, MBTI, badminton, downhill skiing, and biostatistics world. My personal website (which is still being built and has lots of the unfinished): https://kristywhim.netlify.app/
