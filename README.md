### Hello ä½ å¥½ ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a MS candidate in biostatistics department at the Unveristy of North Carolina Chapel Hill. I graduated with a BA degree in statistics (with minors in biology and computer science) at Macalester College in 2023. Please  feel free to visit my personal website (which is still being built and has lots of the unfinished): https://kristywhim.netlify.app/
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning many statistical courses to enrich my study life! Who would know this! I was a biology person for quite a long time during college and even have once decided to go for pre-med
programs. Then I found out I really hated Physics so I gave up on that. But anyways, I am still very excited to reunion with biology from statistical perspective.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on statistical genetics projects that involves cancer and GWAS. Researching for research is in progress!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about K-pop, EDM, China, and biostatistics world!
